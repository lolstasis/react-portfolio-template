    "I've coached hundreds of students from all elos and all roles, drawing from my experiences with hitting master elo on every role, as well as my experiences from starting in Bronze 5 in Season 6 and being hardstuck for over a year and a half straight. Eventually I climbed to diamond in my second year of playing, and master in my third. I understand the frustration, and what it's like to try as hard as possible, but still unable to make any progress at all.",

Overall would give a 10/10 he nailed it on the head of exactly what I needed, 100% worth the time and money if you are looking for a coach.", // Add Your Service Type Here

Replay analysis makes a huge difference with a positive vibe you are left with like it’s all possible when you know your most impactful points to be fixed. I feel thankful.

  // About Secton --------------
  aboutParaOne:
    "I'm Zach, but I mostly go by Stasis(I've also gone by Produx and Dogma), and I'm a Grandmaster Coach. I started bronze in Season 6, staying Bronze 5 (the equivalent of Iron 4) for about a year and a half straight. A year later, I climbed to Diamond 5 (back when the fifth divisions actually existed), and a year after that I reached Master tier for the first time, peaking at 250 LP(which was roughly ladder rank 240 something at the time). My journey was long(I spammed thousands of games), and mostly owed to the incredible amount of coaching and educational content that I consumed, but my story was a lucky one. There is a veritable ocean of educational content out there, but not all of it is created equal, very often it lacks accuracy, or the context to make it accurate, creating pretty hefty amounts of confusion. Fortunately, most of the content that I had read, watched, and studied had that accuracy and context, and I was able to reach the elo that I did. Sometimes, however, a guiding hand is needed to help navigate the rough waters that is improvement. And that's where I step in.",
  aboutParaTwo:
    "When I began my journey, I was the quintessential bronze (or iron, I suppose) player that you likely despised having on your team. I blamed my teammates for everything, and had excuses for any mistake or misplay that I made. I flamed and ping spammed, I trolled and griefed. After a year and a half of this, I eventually came to the conclusion that maybe it was me who was playing poorly. And thus, I subsequently spent hundreds of hours(I was a highschool student at the time, with an astonishing amount of free time) devouring all the educational content that I could. Not all people have that free time, and the path was not easy. I reached Diamond 5, but it was at the expense of thousands of hours of effort. And as mentioned before, not many people have the free time needed to improve with that method. I can help there. With the vast quantity of experience I have both playing and coaching the game, I can ensure that with my help, we can achieve greatness, no matter how you define it.",
  aboutParaThree:
    "I love coaching people. Watching others improve is satisfying in ways that words can not describe. While I specialize in carry junglers (my favorite champions being Kha'Zix, Karthus, and Viego), I've hit master elo playing all roles, and as such I can help you regardless of the role or champions that you play. I hope to see you soon!",

  promotionPara:
    "In our session, you will learn all of these things, and so much more. While League of Legends is a complex game, dividing it into bite sized pieces of information allows players to learn much quicker. While it seems daunting to be faced with so many different things to learn, rest assured that you will have someone with you every step of the way. There are numerous coaching methods, but the one that I find most consistent and beneficial to student success are VOD reviews. Screen recorded VOD reviews with clicks and camera control are far more useful for improvement than live coaching or strictly league replay analysis. While I am willing to coach in other methods, I highly recommend recording your gameplay with a screen recording software such as lowkey.gg, outplayed, medal.tv, or OBS, and uploading it to YouTube or some other service before the session. Currently, I charge $20 per session, which generally fall around the hour long mark in terms of length. I also coach teams, but my rates there are different and depend on what my function is, and what my expected role is to support the team. To book a session, either email me or message me on discord(stasis#2222). Save 10% when booking three or more sessions in advance, with weeklong and monthlong bootcamp packages available for interested students. Payment can be made through Paypal, BTC, or ETH. I'm currently working on accepting other payment methods, so join my discord to stay posted on updates for that.",
