Super helpful and friendly, and even continued to help me after I had finished with the coaching session, thought me some overall macro things and some very niche micro things for the champ that I was playing. Overall would give a 10/10 he nailed it on the head of exactly what I needed, 100% worth the time and money if you are looking for a coach.", // Add Your Service Type Here

Helped a lot with my Kha’Zix runes, builds, explained everything I was asking about in all the details that probably doesn’t matter in my low silver, but now I feel like I know everything that I need so I feel secure in that way haha. Replay analysis makes a huge difference with a positive vibe you are left with like it’s all possible when you know your most impactful points to be fixed. I feel thankful.

Not only is he a killer coach that isn't scared to tell you exactly what you're doing wrong and exactly how to win, he has even helped a bit with my collegiate club team, just reinforcing the investment he puts towards his students. 10/10 would recommend if you are looking to improve your gameplay.", // Add Your Service Type Here

  aboutParaOne:
    "The first person I coached to high elo was myself. No one would have pegged me for an eventual high elo player; I was hardstuck bronze for over a year. Youtube and Reddit didn't help; I realized that the internet is flooded with league content, most of it not very useful. I know what it's like to plateau and to feel like being good at League is an impossible dream.",
  aboutParaTwo:
    "League of Legends is one of the most complex games ever made. There's no reason to try to reinvent the wheel alone. Working together we can raise your skills faster and more efficiently.",
  aboutParaThree:
    "In League I go by Stasis; if you want you can call me Zach. I grew up in Florida playing video games and reading anything I could get my hands on. Nowadays you can find me hiding from the sun or worshipping Terry Pratchett.",
